So about 2 or 3 months ago I started freelancing again, blyme times flies past. I wrote two blogposts about my journey hoping it'll help others to be successful with their freelancing. There is so much exciting stuff to learn about running a business and I'll attempt to share my observations in the hope that it'll help fellow freelancers.

So this post is actually not just for freelancers, it's broader. It's about finding your niche, whatever job you're in.

## Why specialize.
I've gone over this in previous blog posts, but lets recap, it's simple really:
If you specialize...
- You have less competition to deal with.
- You can build up specialized expertise, providing more value to the projects you work on.
- You can focus - you won't have to spread yourself too thinly

## Love what you're doing, do what you love.
It's a cliche I know and you're probably tired of hearing it. But it's true. If you want to be really good at what you're doing, you need to enjoy what you're doing. Motivation is a key ingredient to professional success. The drive that comes from doing something you thoroughly enjoy can fuel your career more than anything else. Do something that you enjoy doing and your output will be better, your clients/bosses will be happier too. Positive feedback will in turn motivate you even further.

## Don't specialize for the sake of it.
When you're starting out and even when you're fairly experienced, it can be difficult to know what you want to be doing. Forcing yourself into a niche won't work. So rather than rushing this step, take your time.

You don't need to specialize right away. Finding something that you really love involves a lot of wading through piles of crap. Like finding a good netflix show, or a great band. The longer you're looking, the better you'll get at finding the type of work that you really love. But for that to happen, it's good to start broad and learn all the things and by doing so you'll be able to figure out which things you like and which things you don't.

## Always keep looking.
Our industry is evolving fast. In the early noughties, JavaScript was hardly taken seriously, front-end development was very niche, some of us were still called Webmasters back then (phew that's behind us). It was niche enough to just be a frontend-developer then, you were one of a few. Nowadays I look at job-adverts from London recruiting agents and everyone is looking for a react developer here, an angular developer there, a vue.js developer, or an ember.js expert. There are communities built around particular front-end technologies and the speed at which they are diversifying is incredible. And with that diversification comes more opportunity for specialization.

When I started freelancing again I did a bunch of things. One gig was project management, on another I did backend (node.js) work and then on another I worked on a draft-js frontend. The draft.js work was by far the most enjoyable gig for me. Writing text editors has always been a passion of mine and it suddenly clicked - what if I could just specialise doing that?

## Be active in your community
Once you find a niche that you're passionate about, try to make yourself heard in that space. The drive that you get from doing something you enjoy doing will help you push yourself. Here's a couple of things that you could be doing:

### Supporting s
- Write blog posts
- Maybe make video tutorials
- Open source work.
