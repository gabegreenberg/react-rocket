title: If you don't want your project to fail, write specifications

description: Specifications have a place, even in an agile environment. Without them, there's a high chance of miscommunication between your product and engineering team.

Let's assume you work on software products. It's likely you have run into the following problems:

- Your engineering team's output does not match the expectations of the client or product owner.
- Engineering work feels haphazard and poorly planned.
- The motiviations for a feature are hard to rationalize for the engineering.
- Projects deadlines are missed repeatedly.
- Engineering feel they have little understanding of the business value of the project or feature they're working on.
- Your App feels like it is designed by engineers because a lot of UX decisions are made during implementation.
- A lot of time and resource are being spent on last-minute feedback.
- A lot of decision-making around a project is made without everyone involved.
- There's a lot of he-said she-said during and after the execution of a project.

I've seen these problems occur a lot and chances are so have you. It was during my tenure at rainforest (summer 2016), a young product team had just formed - consisting of [Ot√†vio Dalarossa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalarossa/) and [Lita Stevenson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lita-stephenson-27b1755b/) - that I learnt what the most effective 

Even now, having l leaving rainforest, I insist on good specifications (whether I write them or not), because they are so often the deciding factor between success or failure.

## What 
At their core, specifications align the stakeholders with the engineering team. They provide documentation on what should be built, what requirements this feature or product should meet and sometimes even how it should be executed. Everything that 


## Contents of a good specification

Depending on the kind of project you're working on, it might not always be possible to cover all these points, but I'll always try to have as many of these points in a specification as possible/needed.


1. What is the problem that needs solving?
2. Why is this problem worth solving?
3. What does success for this project look like?
you should relate this point as much as you can back to __1__ and __2__ to make for a coherent story
4. What is the simplest solution to fix this problem?
5. User Scenarios - What flow does a user go through to achive his goal?
6. Wireframes
7. Implementation Details
